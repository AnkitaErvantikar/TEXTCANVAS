TEXTCANVAS is a sophisticated text-to-image generation tool leveraging the power of the Stable Diffusion model and advanced natural language processing techniques. This project encapsulates a comprehensive solution for generating images from textual   descriptions, utilizing Flask for the backend and a simple, user-friendly web interface.

Project Structure
	The TEXTCANVAS folder contains the following components:
	Backend:
    A Flask application to handle text input, process it through the Stable Diffusion model, and return the generated image.
    Integration of NLP and image generation models to create visually appealing images from text prompts.
Frontend:
    A minimalistic HTML and JavaScript-based interface for users to input their text prompts and view the generated images.
    Simple and intuitive design to enhance user experience.
    
The TEXT TO IMAGE GENERATION file contains:
    A Jupyter notebook with Google Colab code for running the text-to-image generation process.
    Step-by-step instructions and code blocks for setting up and executing the model.

Due to the computational intensity of the Stable Diffusion model, this project requires significant hardware resources. 
Specifically, the text-to-image generation process requires more than 8 GPUs to ensure efficient processing and timely 
results. This requirement is essential to handle the large-scale computations involved in generating high-quality images 
from text descriptions.
